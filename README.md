# Contributing to the Repository

Follow these steps to contribute to the `banking-app` repository:

1. **Copy the Repository**: Make a copy of the repository on your computer.

```
git clone git@github.com:pan-de-salita/banking-app.git
```


2. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for each new feature or fix. A branch is like a prototype of the codebase. A branch allows you to experiment with the codebase you copied without affecting the original or main codebase.

```
git checkout -b FEATURE_NAME
```


3. **Update Your Copy**: Update your copy of the repository to make sure it's up to date. This ensures your local copy is up to date with the latest changes, helping avoid conflicts.

```
git pull origin main
```


4. **Make Changes**: Start making changes to the code on your computer.


5. **Prepare Your Changes**: Prepare these changes to be saved.

```
git add .
```


6. **Save Your Changes**: Save your changes to your computer's copy of the repository.

```
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
```


7. **Send Your Changes**: Send these changes to the repository on GitHub.

```
git push -u origin feature/new-feature
```


8. **Fix Any Problems**: If there are any problems between your changes and the changes in the repository on GitHub, you'll need to fix these problems yourself.


9. **Combine Your Changes**: After sending your changes to a new folder, you can ask someone to look at your changes and combine them into the main folder.
